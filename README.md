# Sheep_Counter
Task given by RoboVITics.
#Problem Statement: Imagine a flock of sheep, one by one moving in and out of a fenced grassland. Now the shepherd wants a device attached to the fence door that keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land. So your task is to create a Tinkercad simulation of a device that is suitable for this job.
##Solution: Using two ultrasonic sensors at exit and entry gate to monitor movement of sheeps (entering and exiting) and changing count based on observed data. 
###Assumptions: Two distinct gates for entry and exit. 
             Fixed gate width.
             Fixed amount of time taken by a sheep to exit or enter.
             No sheep lingering in range of sensor.
